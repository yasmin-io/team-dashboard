# Team Dashboard

---

I have built a command-line application in aim to help Managers have a designated webpage that displays their teams basic information. I have utillised Node.js, Jest, Inquirer, and JavaScript to create Team Dashboard. This was my opportunity to expand my knowledge using these technologies and practice my use of tests, classes and constructors.

## How It Works?

---

```
Team Dashboard should display your teams information.

- The user is able to type `node index.js` in the command-line to start the application.

- Then it prompts the Manager to input Name, Employee ID, Email Address, and Office Number.

- You are then presented with multiple options on whether you want to: Add an Intern, Add an Engineer, or Finish your Team.

- When you select 'Intern', you are prompted to input the Employees Name, Employee ID, Email Address, and School.

- When you select 'Engineer', you are prompted to input the Employees Name, Employee ID, Email Address, and GitHub.

- When you select the 'Finish' option, a HTML file is generated that displays your team rosters information based off the information you provided.
```

I have created a walkthrough video that will help you understand the full functionality of the command-line application I have built.

When the application runs, you are presented with these questions:

## READ BEFORE USE!!

#### Information Display Issue

Unfortunatley, my website is currently unable to display the user input information. The application takes the input information and logs it in the command-line. However, you will notice it won't display on the website. I have had a problem arise in my code and this will be fixed promptly.

Thank-You for your understanding

The full release will come soon!!
